UW Underwater Technology
========================

*We are a club (RSO) at the University of Washington working on an underwater
remotely operated vehicle that will compete in MATE's annual international
competition as well as aid in faculty research.*

GRAPHICLA USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE
----------------

The graphical user interface (or GUI) will have 3 components:

*	Library to listen to and interpret messages being sent from the surface arduino
	to the surface computer.
*	Accessing and Displaying realtime frames of a video feed (either usb or ethernet)
	*	How to bring an ethernet video feed into OpenCV:

*	Drawing graphical elements on top of or surrounding the video feed that allow for
	user interaction
	*	How to draw transparent overlays in OpenCV:
